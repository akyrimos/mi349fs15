				<h2>Welcome to the Web of Maason!</h2>
					<p>You can navigate through the website by clicking on the well designed links in the navigation bar. If you ever get lost, click on "Home" and you'll be brought back here.
						If only life had a similar function...</p>
			
				<h2>So... What is the Web of Maason?</h2>
					<p> Simply put, the Web of Maason is a website created by none other than me. I've been working on the Web of Maason on and off for about a month now, and I think it's really come together.
					I've spent hours poring over HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I have meticulously edited and rearranged pictures for the headers and the gallery. I have delved through page after page of W3 Schools because
					I'm too lazy to remember how to change font colors in CSS (hint: it's just "color". You don't need to add font-color or type-color). All of this is done in hopes of impressing an employer enough to hire me.
					Oh, and getting a good grade on this final project. Can't forget that. I've definitely enjoyed my time in MI 349. The class has taught me a lot of what I consider applicable life skills.</p>
					<p>What you see is a result of that. Please try not to judge too harshly.</p>
