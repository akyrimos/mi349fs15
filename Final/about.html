				<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Oh boy. Where do I even begin? Well, I was born here, in the United States. I think it was a hospital in Jackson, Michigan. I'm not too sure, so I'll get back to you on that one. I lived in 
					Michigan for the next couple years, moving once or twice from an apartment to a house. I remember 9/11. I was in first or second grade, and I couldn't understand the significance of what was going on. 
					Everybody else looked shocked, so I looked shocked too. A couple years later, the whole family packs up and moves to the largest city you've never even heard of: Tianjin, China. Over ten million people
					living under a layer of obscurity, industry, and smog.</p>
					
					<p>I lived there for the next ten years, from when I was eight to eighteen. I attended an American international school called Tianjin International School, or TIS for short. It was K-12. The entire school
					ranged somewhere between four hundred and five hundred students, which, to my knowledge, is less than the number of people in a single grade in an American public school. My class had around thirty, which
					was considered large. I went to school with the same people for ten years. Sure, there were students that came and went, but growing up with people in a foreign country for ten years means that you'll have
					a friendship that is not easily broken. </p>
					
					<p>My senior year in high school, I applied to six or seven colleges. Michigan State University, University of Michigan, Notre Dame, Villanova, Northwestern, Wake Forest, and... I don't even remember. It's
					not important. What is important though, is that every single college rejected me except Michigan State University. Remember kids, it's always better to bank on your grades and ACT/SAT scores rather than your 
					ethnicity, especially when you're Asian and not Black/Native American.</p>
					
					<p>When I first got to MSU, it was perhaps, the worst year of my life. How do I put it? I wasn't American. Having lived ten years in China, I had next to no interest in sports, drinking, or partying. And 
					from what I saw, those reasons were pretty much why people chose to go to Michigan State. The people that didn't choose to go and still showed up were probably in my boat. I had no friends. My roommate didn't
					even bother showing up. I had a two person bedroom all to myself for a semester. I only knew one person from when I lived here. Ten years ago. I wasn't American, but I wasn't Chinese either. I can speak Mandarin
					and understand what people are saying to a reasonable extent. I can read, barely. I can't write at all. Any Chinese native will know I'm not Chinese instantly, despite having lived in the country. I think it 
					suffices to say I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere. The loneliness was crippling at times. </p>
					
					<p>This story, however, doesn't have a sad ending. After that first year, I got my act together. I found a group of people who shared similar interests (Namely: Dota 2, Magic: the Gathering, and Dungeons and Dragons).
					I got a job in MSU's IT department, where I befriended my coworkers and found my major in Media and Information. Before that, I was in Packaging. And let's be honest; Packaging probably pays well, and you'll have 
					decent job security, but at the end of the day, you still have a job in Packaging. I'm not trying to disparage the major or anything, but you know. You get my drift. And that's it! We're all caught up to the present.</p> 
			
				<h2>Oh Future, Where Art Thou?</h2>
					<p>So where do I want to go from here? Well, I am graduating in the Winter of 2016, given that nothing goes horribly wrong. I am aiming for an internship for the summer of 2016. I have extensive experience
					working as desktop support. However, I would like to intern at a data center, as I believe that would allow me to use my current skills while learning new ones. The goal of the internship for me would be to contribute
					in a meaningful way while expanding my knowledge and repertoire  of skills.</p>
