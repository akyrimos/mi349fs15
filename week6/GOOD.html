				<h2> On Empty Spaces</h2>
					<p id="cheating"> One might question if this violates the "interesting content" rule. I'm not so sure, but there was a large blank space on my homepage, and I felt like I had to fill it up with
					<i>something</i>. So here you have it: a paragraph of meaningless ramble intended to fill up the empty space left behind by having a picture that is just too large. A smart person might
					reduce the size of the image, or even put up a second picture to compensate for the first. But not me. Because I started writing before I started thinking and now I reap what I sow. </p>
