	<h2> Short Pitch </h2>
		
		<p> A website I can use to get a good grade and show future employers what I am capable of.</p>
	
	<h2> Long Pitch </h2>
	
		<p> I want to create a website that displays my abilities as a Media & Information major. 
		It will be aesthetically pleasing, with an easy to  understand and easy to navigate GUI. 
		People should be able to go to whatever part of the website they need to when they want to. 
		The information contained on the pages will pertain to my abilities and skills, including my resume, 
		past work, and the kind of jobs I am looking for.</p>
